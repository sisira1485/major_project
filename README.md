# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms
This project aims to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease using machine learning algorithms.

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
####Install Python if you haven't already. 
####Install Django framework using pip: 
      pip install django. 
####Navigate to your project directory in the command prompt.
####Run the Django development server using the command: 
       python manage.py runserver.
####This command starts the development server, allowing you to view and interact with your Django application locally by visiting http://127.0.0.1:8000/ or http://localhost:8000/ in your web browser.

## Built With
